Three Card Component Project:

    The Three card component uses a mixture of HTML, CSS, and flexbox. I decided to start with flexbox to get a feel for how it works
    and seeing how normal HTML and CSS work with flexbox.

HTML:

    The project was not to hard to set up, as the main parts of the projects are three divs that offer different content
    on each div. The three divs are wrapped in a single flex-box container that allows easier use for moving the divs around.

CSS:

    For a seemingly simple project there was more CSS than I first thought there would be. 
    Each card required different CSS as the buttons change once they are hovered over.

Flexbox:

    The use of flexbox allowed me to easily align and center the three card components. 
    I found the gelx box to especially useful in the case of making the design responsive.
    A media query was added at a point and then sets the flex-direction to column, this shifts the 
    three card components on top of each other to match screens of different size

Future Updates:

    I would like to add animations to the buttons when they are clicked and have each button lead to a different page
    Eventually, I would like to have a version that uses plain CSS to strengthen CSS skills and one version
    that uses SASS to learn and grow more in that area.
    Finally, I would like to add more content to the actual project
